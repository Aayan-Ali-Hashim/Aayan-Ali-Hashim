# Hi there 👋 I am Aayan Ali Hashim
<p style="text-align:center;">Python Developer | Python Tutor | Data Science Learner</p>
I have 2+ years of experience in teaching Python online to people of all age groups. I can even teach Python to a 7 year old boy ! 
I started learning data science from 2022 but at that time I wasn't able to focus alot. In the beginning from 2024, I started an onsite course,
professional Software Development course in which I learnt full Stack development.
I also know Web Development both frontend and backend using JavaScript but I am more interested in learning Data Science. So I am doing an online MLOPs course to learn complete Machine learning, NLP , Deep Learning.
Now this time , I also know frontend development , backend which will help me to integrate my models and provide users a better experience so in short I can now solve problem completely.
